# Voicelet

Voicelet is a TypeScript background worker that receives Discord voice-state events and exposes
operational liveness, readiness, and metrics endpoints.

## Prerequisites

- Volta with Node 24.20.0; entering this repository automatically selects the pinned runtime.
- pnpm 10.15.0 installed through Volta.

## Setup and start

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
cp .env.example .env
pnpm dev
```

For a live Discord connection, set `DISCORD_TOKEN` in `.env` and enable only the
`GuildVoiceStates` intent. Never commit `.env` or a token. The worker loads `.env` before
validating configuration. For a credential-free local readiness check, set
`GATEWAY_MODE=simulated`; the simulated Gateway automatically emits ready.

The operational endpoints are `GET /livez`, `GET /readyz`, and `GET /metrics`. A Unix-domain
`SOCKET_PATH` is available for process-level local tests; ordinary development uses `HOST` and
`PORT`.
